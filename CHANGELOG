    2008-09-03, Hung Luu:
        - Expose python-memcached as a limited service so Service Registry Admin can get/set from/to memcached.
        - Replace individual restful parameters with one "requesturl" parameter.
    2008-09-09, Hung Luu:
        - Renamed "requesturl" to "request_path".
        - Renamed "expiryminutes" to "expiry_minutes".
        - Added a diagnostics service command to grab log entries based on a date range.
    2008-09-15, Hung Luu:
        - Added a Win32 event handler to ignore the logoff event.
        - Strip leading and trailing whitespace from URL patterns.

        - Check memcached first for the content expiry minutes, then fallback to Settings.config.
        - Refactor diagnostics params formatting.
    2008-11-17, Hung Luu:
        - Write content meta in the first few bytes to help clients better parse response:
            First 2 bytes: x number of bytes to read after the first 2 bytes, which should represent the content length.
            Next x bytes: y number of bytes in the content.
            Next y bytes: The actual content.
        - Changed name to 'Content Proxy'.
        - Support cache meta in ModulePrefs of Gadget XML.
        - Cleanup of cache set ops with expiration.
        - Converted all print statements to print function calls for Python 3000.
        - Added a stats command for diagnostics.
